## About

TReND links is a spin-off portal run by TReND in Africa intended to facilitate academic and cultural exchange between (neuro)scientists worldwide.

The service is 100% free and offers any (neuro)scientist the possibility to submit a brief academic profile and then browse for like-minded scientists abroad.

By registering with TReND links, scientists agree to be politely contacted via email in academic matters, to offer advice, share protocols or discuss options for scientific collaboration.

Links are intended to foster global exchange, fruitful scientific progress as well as personal friendships.
